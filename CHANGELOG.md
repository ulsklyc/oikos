## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.0] - 2026-03-30

### Changed
- Directional slide-x page transitions (forward = right, backward = left) with race condition guard
- PWA install prompt delayed until 2 user interactions; dismiss window reduced from 30 to 7 days; interaction counter resets on dismiss
- Unified card padding to 16px (`--space-4`) across tasks, contacts, budget, and meals modules

### Added
- Staggered fade-in animation for list items on page load across all modules (tasks, shopping, meals, contacts, budget, notes, calendar agenda)
- Unified empty states using shared `.empty-state` class across all modules (replaces per-module CSS)
- `stagger()` and `vibrate()` UX utilities in `public/utils/ux.js` with full test coverage
- Proportional opacity on swipe-reveal action areas in tasks (already implemented, confirmed)
- FAB colors tied to per-module accent tokens via CSS custom properties
- `scrollIntoView` for focused inputs when virtual keyboard opens in modals (300ms delay)
- Consistent vibration feedback via `vibrate()` utility across tasks, shopping, contacts, budget, and notes
- Bottom sheet modal on mobile (< 768px) with drag handle, slide-in animation, and swipe-to-close
- Enter-key navigation between form fields in modals; Enter on last field triggers submit
- Blur-triggered inline validation for required fields with error/success border states
- `wireBlurValidation()`, `btnSuccess()`, and `btnError()` exported from `modal.js`
- Submit button checkmark-success (700ms) and shake-error feedback animations

## [0.1.0] - 2026-03-29

Initial release of Oikos — a self-hosted family planner for 2–6 person households. Runs as a Docker container behind Nginx with SSL, no cloud dependency.

### Added

- **Dashboard** with time-of-day greeting, urgent tasks, upcoming events, today's meals, pinned notes, and weather widget (OpenWeatherMap integration with 3–5 day forecast scaling by screen size)
- **Task management** with categories, priorities, due dates, subtasks (max 2 levels), list and Kanban views, swipe gestures on mobile (swipe left = toggle done, swipe right = edit), and recurring tasks via iCal RRULE
- **Shopping lists** with multiple named lists, supermarket-aisle sorting, autocomplete from history, optimistic checkbox toggle, and bulk-clear of checked items
- **Weekly meal planner** with breakfast/lunch/dinner/snack grid (Mon–Sun), ingredient tracking per meal, and one-click transfer of ingredients to shopping lists
- **Calendar** with month, week, day, and agenda views, multi-day event support, color-coded entries, and family member assignment
- **Google Calendar sync** via OAuth 2.0 with incremental sync tokens and **Apple CalDAV sync** via tsdav, both bidirectional
- **Pinboard** (notes) with color-coded sticky notes, pin-to-top, Markdown formatting toolbar (bold, italic, lists, headings, code, links), and automatic text contrast based on background color
- **Contacts** directory with category filtering (doctor, emergency, trades, etc.), full-text search, and direct tel:/mailto:/maps: links
- **Budget tracker** with income/expense logging, monthly navigation, category breakdown bar charts (pure CSS), and CSV export
- **Settings page** for password change, calendar sync status, and family member management
- **Authentication** with session-based login (bcrypt, httpOnly/secure/sameSite cookies, 7-day TTL), admin-only user creation, and rate-limited login (5 attempts/min with 15-min lockout)
- **CSRF protection** using Double Submit Cookie pattern with timing-safe comparison
- **Progressive Web App** with app-shell caching (service worker with stale-while-revalidate for static assets, network-first for navigation, network-only for API), custom install prompt for Android and iOS, dynamic theme-color per module, safe area inset handling, and offline fallback
- **Responsive design** with mobile bottom navigation (swipeable pages with dot indicator), collapsible sidebar on tablet, and full sidebar on desktop
- **Dark mode** with system preference detection and manual toggle, warm-tinted neutral color scale
- **Design system** with CSS custom properties (tokens for colors, spacing, typography, shadows, radii, z-indices), module-specific accent colors, and consistent component patterns
- **Accessibility** improvements: skip link, sr-only headings on all pages, aria-hidden decorative icons, aria-label on icon-only buttons, token-based touch targets (44–48px), 12px minimum font size, and prefers-reduced-motion support
- **Docker deployment** with docker-compose, optional SQLCipher encryption (AES-256), and nginx.conf example
- **Setup script** (`node setup.js`) for initial admin account creation with LAN-reachable URL display
- **Input validation** middleware with centralized rules (string length, date/time format, enum, color) across all API routes
- **Content Security Policy** via Helmet with strict CSP, self-hosted Lucide Icons (no CDN at runtime)
- **Lazy loading** with per-page ES module imports cached in memory, Cache-Control headers (immutable for assets, must-revalidate for code), and service worker update notification

### Security

- Fail-fast on missing `SESSION_SECRET` in production
- Rate limiting on login endpoint and global API limiter (300 req/min/IP)
- No user data cached by service worker (API requests are network-only)
- Hardened `.gitignore` and `.dockerignore` to prevent accidental secret or binary leakage
